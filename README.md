Church Content WordPress Plugin
=============================

A WordPress plugin from [ChurchThemes.com](https://churchthemes.com) providing compatible themes with church-related post types, taxonomies and fields. This plugin was previously named "Church Theme Content".

Purpose
-------

Church Content provides functionality enabling the user to manage *sermons*, *events*, *people* and *locations* to be displayed by a compatible theme.

Experienced WordPress developers agree that functionality like this does not belong in themes since themes are intended only to control the appearance of a WordPress site. Content that users might expect to take with them if they switch themes should "live" in a plugin. Similarly, our approach is not to display content using the plugin since themes offer more control for that purpose.

Developers
----------

The Church Content plugin was made in a way that other church theme developers can take advantage of it. A couple benefits are that you will save time and be helping to accomplish better data portability among church websites powered by WordPress.
